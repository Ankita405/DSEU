    <h1>Centre for External Relations and Partnerships</h1>

    <p>The Delhi Skill and Entrepreneurship University (DSEU)’s demand-driven curriculum and rigorous 
        pedagogy enable students to acquire 21st-century skills. These skills directly cater to the needs of 
        the industry, thus, bridging the skill gap and nurturing an industry-ready workforce. DSEU believes that
         creating an enabling ecosystem that can provide industry-centric skill education, eventually raises the 
         employability quotient and ensures meaningful jobs and livelihoods for students from all walks of life.
          This belief is driven through DSEU’s dedicated Centre for External Relations and Partnerships (CERP), which
           has its foundation in the mantra of involving industry in every activity from curriculum design, expert guest
            lectures, Industry projects, faculty development, internships to placements. The Centre for External Relations
             and Partnerships is designed to focus on five critical areas namely:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>External Relations</li>
        <li>Consulting</li>
        <li>Pre-Placement</li>
        <li>Alumni Relations</li>
        <li>Student Chapters</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The CERP works with a broader vision of:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Developing and facilitating effective long-term mutually beneficial partnerships with national/international organisations,
             academic bodies, experts, and communities.</li>
        <li>Providing placement assistance to students and conducting on-campus internship and placement drives.</li>
        <li>Planning and organising year-round industry interface activities.</li>
        <li>Providing pre-placement support in terms of personality development and grooming through one-on-one counselling,
             workshops on resume building and mock interviews, etc.</li>
        <li>Providing internship and apprenticeship to every student.</li>
        <li>Connecting alumni and industry professionals with the university at large.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Consultancy</h2>

    <p>Consultancy constitutes an important activity in any University, as it provides wide exposure to real-life problems
         which require solutions in specific time frames. Consultancy assignments are professionally enriching and help in improving 
         the quality of teaching, learning, and research and development of the faculty. We believe through consultancy provided by 
         faculty DSEU cannot only address the problems of the Industry but also Society at large, through technological solutions and 
         decisions aimed at corrective measures.</p>
    <p>Consultancy is one way in which it opens the door for academia-industry interaction, state-of-the-art research, enriching the 
        experience of staff, and upgrading the facilities of the Institution.</p>
    <p>Our faculty have been involved in consultancy assignments, and we invite industry to bring some of their problems to us. Some examples are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Conduct of trade test provided by Abscissa by Chemical Department, GND Rohini.</li>
        <li>DST Sponsored the project on “Development of IoT based hybrid navigation module for mid-sized autonomous vehicles”.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Placements</h2>

    <p>In today’s changing times, campus placements hold an even greater importance for students. Widespread competition and
         fewer choices make it even more difficult to tap the right opportunities. Campus placements, therefore, provide the 
         students with a foot-in-the-door, enabling them to start off their career right after they have completed their course 
         curriculum. Furthermore, they get to interact and engage with the industry professionals during the placement drives, 
         which further help lay a foundation for their prospective career in the future as they familiarize themselves with potential
          contacts from their chosen career field. DSEU campuses over the last 6 months have organised more than 100 campus placement 
          drives where companies like Maruti, Bajaj Motors, LG, Sony, Infosys, Wipro, Deloitte and many others have participated and more
           than 2500 offers were made for placement. DSEU also organised a 3-day Job Utsav in the month of May where more than 26 companies, 
           1600 students participated and 1490 offers were rolled. Below mentioned is the highlight of the 2021-22 placements.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>2553 offers rolled till now through different placement activities</li>
        <li>1063 students have got placement through various campus drives</li>
        <li>1490 offers were rolled out in the 3-day Job Utsav</li>
        <li>Companies like Maruti, New Allenberry and Bajaj have taken more than 200 students from different campuses</li>
        <li>94% interested students from B.Tech program got campus placements.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Placement for all the interested students is the ultimate objective of the university.</p>
